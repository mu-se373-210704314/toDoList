# toDoList

Problem Definition:

Design and implement a to-do list application for Android using Jetpack Compose. The application should allow users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently. The primary goal is to provide users with a streamlined task management experience, enhancing productivity and organization.

Key Features:
1. Task Creation: Users should be able to add new tasks to the to-do list. This includes specifying task names, due dates, priorities, and any additional details.

2. Task Management: The application should support editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. Users should have the ability to update task details and track task completion status.

3. Task Organization: Implement functionality to organize tasks into categories or lists. This feature enables users to group tasks based on project, priority, or other criteria for better organization and management.

4. Task Filtering and Sorting: Provide options for users to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria such as due date, priority, or completion status. This feature enhances task visibility and helps users focus on specific tasks.

5. Reminders and Notifications: Enable users to set reminders and receive notifications for upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks. Customizable reminder settings should allow users to configure alerts according to their preferences.

6. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using Jetpack Compose. The interface should feature smooth navigation, clear task representation, and interactive elements for seamless task management.

7. Data Persistence: Implement data persistence to store users' task lists locally on the device. This ensures that task data is retained even when the application is closed or restarted.

8. Accessibility and Localization: Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities and supports localization for multiple languages and regions. This enhances usability and inclusivity for a diverse user base.

By addressing these key features and considerations, the to-do list application aims to provide users with a robust and user-friendly solution for managing their tasks effectively on Android devices using Jetpack Compose.
